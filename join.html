         The Osmond lab is located at the University of Toronto on the St. George downtown campus. If you are interested in working with us, as an undergraduate, grad student, postdoc, or collaborator, please see the relevant section below. We are very open in terms of topic (within ecology and evolution) but will be best able to help you if what you want to learn/do is mathematical modeling. That said, if your interests are more empirical in nature we could potentially find co-supervisors to help (our EEB department is full of <a href="https://eeb.utoronto.ca/people/faculty/">amazing people!</a>). The Osmond lab values diverse perspectives and backgrounds and strives to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone. <b>We look forward to hearing from you!</b>

         <p>
         <b>Prospective undergrads:</b> please send me an email if you are interested in learning about mathematical modeling in ecology and evolution! Possibilities include volunteering, <a href="https://future.utoronto.ca/finances/financial-aid/work-study-program/">a work-study</a>, <a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/undergrad/research.htm">a research course</a>, and <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp">NSERC research awards</a>. (You might also be interested in my modeling course - <a href="https://github.com/mmosmond/eeb430/blob/main/syllabus.md">EEB430</a>.) When emailing me, please respond to the following prompts and attach a CV/resume.
         <ol>
            <li>Please briefly describe your most relevant experience (course experience, research experience, work experience, etc).</li> 
            <li>Why are you interested in research and in this lab? What types of skills and experiences would you like to gain?</li> 
         </ol>
         </p>
         
         <p>
         <b>Prospective grad students:</b> the deadline for applications is early January (see <a href="https://eeb.utoronto.ca/education/graduate/">departmental info</a>). Successful applicants will start the following September. If you are interested in applying please email me first, ideally an entire year before you want to start as many funding opportunities (e.g., <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSD-BESCD_eng.asp">NSERC PhD fellowships</a>) are due the fall before you would begin. When emailing me, indicate whether you are interested in an MSc or PhD, include brief responses to the following prompts, and attach a CV/resume.
         <ol>
            <li>Please briefly describe your most relevant experience (research experience, work experience, upper level course experience, etc).</li>
            <li>Why do you want to pursue graduate research and what are your career ideas beyond graduate school?</li>
            <li>Why are you interested in joining my lab specifically?</li>
            <li>What research directions do you find interesting and what skills would you like to learn during your graduate work?</li>
         </ol>
         See <a href="https://meganbontrager.github.io/join/">the Bontrager Lab's join page</a> for links to some helpful resources. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
         <b>Prospective postdocs:</b> given the (fantastic yet modest) Canadian funding system, your best shot is to email to discuss applying for a fellowship, e.g., 
         <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/about-us/employment/postdocs/eebpostdoc.htm">EEB postdoctoral fellowship</a> (typically due in January)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/awards/arts-science-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/">Arts and Science postdoctoral fellowship</a> (typically due in December)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/awards/provosts-postdoctoral-fellowship-program%e2%80%8b/">Provost's postdoctoral fellowship</a> (typically due in April)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/PDF-BP_eng.asp">NSERC</a> (due in October)</li>
            <li><a href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html">Banting</a> (due in October)</li> 
         </ul>
         When emailing me, please include a brief description of your research to-date, a brief description of your future research interests, and a CV.
