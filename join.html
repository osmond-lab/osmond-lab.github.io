If you are interested in working with us, as an undergraduate, grad student, or postdoc, please see the relevant section below. I am somewhat flexible in terms of topic (within ecology and evolution) but will be best able to help you with mathematical models of evolution. That said, if your interests are more ecological or empirical in nature we could potentially find co-supervisors to help (our EEB department is full of <a href="https://eeb.utoronto.ca/people/faculty/">great people</a>). I value diverse perspectives and backgrounds and strive to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone.

<p>
Please send me an email if you are interested in learning about mathematical modeling in ecology and evolution. Possibilities include a <a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/undergrad/research.htm">research course</a> or a summer <a href="https://eeb.utoronto.ca/education/undergraduate/scholarships-and-awards/">research award</a>. (You might also be interested in taking one of <a href="teaching.html">my courses</a>.) When emailing me, please respond to the following prompts and attach a CV and transcript.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Why are you interested in joining our lab in particular?</li>
  <li>What types of skills and experiences would you like to gain?</li>

<p>
The deadline for applications is typically early January (see <a href="https://eeb.utoronto.ca/education/graduate/">departmental info</a>). Successful applicants typically start the following September. If you are interested in applying please email me first, ideally an entire year before you want to start as many funding opportunities (e.g., <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSD-BESCD_eng.asp">NSERC PhD fellowships</a>) are due the fall before you would begin. When emailing me, indicate whether you are interested in an MSc (domestic students only) or PhD, attach a CV and transcript, and include brief responses to the following prompts.

<p>
Given the (fantastic yet modest) Canadian funding system, your best bet is to email me to discuss applying for a fellowship, e.g., 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/about-us/employment/postdocs/eebpostdoc.htm">EEB postdoctoral fellowship</a> (typically due in January)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/awards/arts-science-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/">Arts and Science postdoctoral fellowship</a> (typically due in December)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/awards/provosts-postdoctoral-fellowship-program%e2%80%8b/">Provost's postdoctoral fellowship</a> (typically due in April)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/PDF-BP_eng.asp">NSERC</a> (due in October)</li>
  <li><a href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html">Banting</a> (due in October)</li> 
</ul>
<p>
When emailing me, please include a brief description of your research to-date, a brief description of your future research interests, and a CV.
