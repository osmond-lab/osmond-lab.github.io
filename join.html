The mmosmond lab will be starting January 2021 at the University of Toronto on the St. George downtown campus. If you are interested in working with us, as an undergraduate, grad student, postdoc, or collaborator, please get in touch via email (see Contact page). Please let us know a little about yourself (e.g., your current and past experience with biology and math) and why you would like to join the lab (see Research and Publications pages for some info on what we do). We are very open in terms of topic (within ecology and evolution) but will be best able to help you if what you want to learn/do is mathematical modeling. That said, if your interests are more empirical in nature we could potentially find co-supervisors to help. The mmosmond lab values diverse perspectives and backgrounds -- we look forward to hearing from you!
