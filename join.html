The Osmond lab is located at the University of Toronto on the St. George downtown campus. If you are interested in working with us, as an undergraduate, grad student, postdoc, or collaborator, please get in touch via email (see <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a> page). Please let us know a little about yourself (e.g., your current and past experience with biology and math) and why you would like to join the lab (see <a href="./research.html">Research</a> and <a href="./publications.html">Publications</a> pages for some info on what we do). We are very open in terms of topic (within ecology and evolution) but will be best able to help you if what you want to learn/do is mathematical modeling. That said, if your interests are more empirical in nature we could potentially find co-supervisors to help. The Osmond lab values diverse perspectives and backgrounds and strives to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone. <b>We look forward to hearing from you!</b>
<br>
<br>

<b>Prospective undergrads:</b> please get in touch if you are interested in learning about mathematical modelling in ecology and evolution! Possibilities include volunteering, <a href="https://future.utoronto.ca/finances/financial-aid/work-study-program/">a work-study</a>, <a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/undergrad/research.htm">a research course</a>, and <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp">NSERC research awards</a>. 
<br>
<br>

<b>Prospective grad students:</b> the deadline for applications is early January (see <a href="https://eeb.utoronto.ca/education/graduate/">departmental info</a>). Successful applicants will start the following September. If you are interested in applying please get in touch with me first, ideally an entire year before you want to start as many funding opportunities (e.g., <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSD-BESCD_eng.asp">NSERC PhD fellowships</a>) are due the fall before you would begin.
<br>
<br>

<b>Prospective postdocs:</b> note that there are a number of fellowships available, e.g., <a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/about-us/employment/postdocs/eebpostdoc.htm">the EEB postdoctoral fellowship</a> (typically due in January), <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/PDF-BP_eng.asp">NSERC</a> (due in October), and <a href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html">Banting</a> (due in October).
